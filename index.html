        <h3>So, you&#39;re a Family CTO? </h3>

<p>If you have been supporting the technical infrastructure of friends and loved ones, this is a movement for you. Let&#39;s stop figuring all this stuff out ourselves. Let&#39;s get some simple checklists together. Let&#39;s share our insights, successes and failures. </p>

<h3>You drive the tech adoption curve</h3>

<p>Because you have taken on the thankless task of keeping everyone safe, productive and happy, you also drive adoption of technology products, services and practices. </p>

<h3>Just getting started here</h3>

<p>There are a million things to do here - but let&#39;s start with some of the basics. Should every family have there own domain (or three)? How do you keep track of all the devices folks are using?</p>

<h3>Join the Movement</h3>

<p>Still figuring out the best way to do this. Github seems to be a good place to start. How about the <a href="https://github.com/FamilyCTO/familycto.github.io-/wiki">Wiki</a></p>

<h3>Ideas, Support or Contact</h3>
